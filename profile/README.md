## About us

Morningwood Gaming is a gaming community built around playing together, improving together, and keeping things welcoming and fun. Whether you’re here for organized events, casual sessions, or community projects, you’re welcome here.

## Our projects

This GitHub organization hosts MWG’s technical projects and community tooling, which may include:

- Website and web services
- Bots and integrations (e.g., Discord automation)
- Game server configuration and infrastructure
- Internal utilities, documentation, and templates

Each repository should document its purpose, how to run it (if applicable), and how to contribute.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from community members.

- Check a repo’s **Issues** for planned work and open tasks
- Look for labels like **good first issue** / **help wanted**
- Open an issue if you want to propose a change before submitting a PR

Organization-wide contribution expectations (and any repo-specific additions) are documented in this org’s shared community files (see below).

## Community guidelines, security, and support

MWG maintains organization-wide community health documentation in the **MW-GC/.github** repository. These files provide default guidance across repositories in this organization (unless a repo overrides them).

Please review:

- **Code of Conduct** (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) — expectations for behavior in MWG spaces
- **Contributing Guide** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) — how we prefer issues, branches, commits, and PRs
- **Security Policy** (`SECURITY.md`) — how to report vulnerabilities responsibly
- **Support** (`SUPPORT.md`) — where to ask questions / get help
