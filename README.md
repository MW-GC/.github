# Morningwood Gaming (.github)

This repository (**MW-GC/.github**) contains GitHub-wide defaults for the Morningwood Gaming organization, including community health files (Code of Conduct, contributing guidelines, security policy, etc.) that apply across repositories in this org.

## What this repository is for

GitHub supports “community health” files stored in an organization’s `.github` repository. When placed here, these files can automatically provide default guidance across repos (unless a repo overrides them with its own versions).

Use this repo to manage:

- **Code of Conduct** and expected behavior standards
- **Contributing** instructions and PR expectations
- **Security** policy and vulnerability reporting guidance
- **Support** and contact/help directions
- Issue / PR templates and organization-wide GitHub configuration

## Community health files

These documents are intended to be maintained **in this repo** and used as org-wide defaults:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — community rules and expectations
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — how to contribute, branch/PR conventions, etc.
- `SECURITY.md` — how to report vulnerabilities responsibly
- `SUPPORT.md` — how to get help / where to ask questions

Depending on how you structure things, you may also include:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` — issue templates
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — PR template
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` — funding links (optional)

## How to contribute to this repo

1. Open an issue describing what you want to change and why
2. Submit a PR with the proposed edits
3. Keep changes clear, minimal, and easy to review
